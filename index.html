		<p>
			Since I started attending <strong>GCU</strong> I have grown as a person. I started trying
			new things like I said I would, I have hiked and tried rock climbing.
			Rock climbing is really difficult and I couldn't get into it so I stuck
			with hiking. I hiked the highest summit in Arizona as my first hike.
			I think my previous experience as a runner helped me. 
			I picked up frisbee again. I used to play ultimate frisbee a lot in 
			middle school, those friends stayed in Washington. Playing
			frisbee is really fun and means a lot to me. I like to visit Washington
			whenever I can so I do check the <a href="https://www.gcu.edu/academics/calendar" 
			target="_blank"> academic calendar</a> a lot. The weather is a <em>little</em>
			bit different from Arizona. One of my favorite things is running in the rain.

			The MP3 file leads to a soundtrack that is meant for a menu in the middle of the game when you pause and youâ€™re
			 taking a break. The guitar adds smooth calming music because the drum set 
			 is the upbeat part and together they work in harmony to comfort the player. The inspiration comes from old nintendo 64 games that I used to play.
			 (starts at 10 seconds)
